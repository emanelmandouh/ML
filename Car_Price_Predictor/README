This file describes the details about Car2Buy , a car predictor ML application that will help user predict car prices based on a specific list of Feature
Step1: Data Loading and Exploration 
- Data Can be Accessed from this link https://github.com/emanelmandouh/ML/blob/main/Car_Price_Predictor/data/vehicles.csv
- The Code Follow CRISP-ML Model that starts by
- Step1: Bussiness Understanding, Formulation 
- Step2: Data Understanding , here we concluded 
  - Data Size is 426,880 Row and 18 Coloumn
  - Some Features such as price, year , odemeter are numerical data type
  - cylinders : no of cylinders is categorical yet need to be converted to numerical
  - VIN, ID : is not clear about their interpretation
  - Some Categorical Data with Large Number of Unique Values Can be Dropped from the Model:  model, VIN, region which make their encoding very difficuilt
  - Some Features have huge number of missed values : size 70% Missed, 40% (cylinder, condition, VIN), ~30% (drive, paint, type)so we need to check further
Step2: Data Mainpulation
  - Drop NA from coloumns with Few Na
  - Complete NA in Cylinders , Change Cylinder to Float, Group by Manufactuerer/Year and Take the Median
  - Extract Missed Type Values from Car Manufacturer Data
  - Drop Coloumns such as ID, VIN
  - Translate Car Year to Car Age
Step3: Study Correlation between Numerical Variables , Categorical Variables w.r.t Output Variable "Price"
  - Price and Odometer have outliers , so data will be filtered to contain cars with odometer < 500,000 and prices < 999,999,999
  - 95% of title_status is clean, so it will not be relevant to our prediction
  - Car age, odometer in range have negative correlation with price, while cylinders have positive impact
  - size : full size came most expensive, transmission : automatic came as most expensive
  - ferrai, tesla, ram. martin came as most expensive cars
  - diesel, electric fuel type drive cars came as most expensive
  - truck, offroad, pickup, bus, van, came =more expensive than other type
  - new, like new, excellent came more expensive than other look category
  - paint color , drive, state has no great impact
Step4 : Modeling
  - Create Dummies for Categorical Data 
  - Multi Linear Regression Model is Excercised with different Feature Selection (Sequential, Ridge, Lasso)
  - GridSearchCV is used for Cross Validation and Alpha Selection in Ridge
